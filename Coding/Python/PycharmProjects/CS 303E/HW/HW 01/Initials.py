# Description of Program: This program aims to use and explore the print statements by printing several lines of code so
# that after running it the output looks like the initials of my whole name in this case C.G.A.M. The initials must be
# 10 characters tall and 12 characters wide, the width of the lines that markup each of the initials is usually 2
# characters but in some cases the width of the line changes to create curvature in the initials. A 2 character by 2
# character "." follows each of the initials to resemble the dot used after writing each of the initials.
